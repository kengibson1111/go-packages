# go-packages
Code samples from golang's default packages. types.md is just my understanding of possible types in golang.
I don't think you can fully understand a language and runtime without understanding available types.

## fmt

Formatted I/O

* printstrings - several samples showing formatting verbs for strings.

* printbytes - same as printstrings only for a byte array.

* rawbytes - more printing but starting with a raw string. Not sure why I would want to use raw strings
  if I have a UTF-8 editor.

* runes - notice the term "char" is not used that much in golang. That is because the Unicode standard
  uses the term "code point". Those include Latin characters we are familiar with and much more. So a
  Unicode code point is a golang "rune". And most of the time it doesn't matter because we usually only
  are interested in Latin characters that can be contained within one byte. We use a for loop one byte
  at a time and everything is fine. We use a for range loop and still everything is fine with Latin
  characters. But with runes, a for range loop will start each iteration at the beginning of the rune
  while a for loop will iterate one byte at a time. Something to think about when processing strings.
  The sample code uses a for range loop. Notice the byte position.

* runesutf8pkg - same results as runes but the code uses the unicode/utf8 package.
