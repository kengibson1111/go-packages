# go-packages
Code samples from golang's default packages. types.md is just my understanding of possible types in golang.
I don't think you can fully understand a language and runtime without understanding available types.

## fmt

Formatted I/O

* printstrings - several samples showing formatting verbs for strings.

* printbytes - same as printstrings only for a byte array.

* rawbytes - more printing but starting with a raw string.
